## Overview

MicroEnv is a simple and lightweight state management library designed to handle application state with minimal complexity. It operates using three core methods: "get", "set", and "call", allowing you to easily retrieve, update, and manipulate state. The "get" method can also return a promise when used with a "next" flag, which enables asynchronous subscription to state changes and simplifies reactivity.
